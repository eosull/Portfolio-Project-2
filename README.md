The goal of this site is to provide some of these talking points and highlight data that enhances the narrative that builds around events like the World Cup.

There are three main stats presented (goals,assists,clean sheets) which are seen as indications of a players effectivness in their position. These are presented in a table which allows comparison between players and to highlight the difference in performances. Alongside this there is an option for the user to generate a commonly used statistic such as goals per game or clean sheet percentage, which gives an indication of the average performance of a player on a game-by-game basis. At the bottom of the site is a flip card which displays the player of the tournament.
